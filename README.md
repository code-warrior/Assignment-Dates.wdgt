# Assignments Dates
## What is This?
A macOS widget that students in my courses can use to note the amount of days left before all assignments are due.

## How Does it Work?
1. Check out the branch associated with your course.
2. Click the green **Clone or download** button, then choose **Download ZIP**.
3. Enable your Dashboard, if it isnâ€™t enabled: Open System Preferences, choose **Mission Control**, then choose **As Space** or **As Overlay** next to the **Dashboard** section.
4. Double-click the widget.
